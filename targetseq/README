IMPORTANT NOTE:  The MASTER copy in this repository is meant to
                 be the latest working copy of the targetSeqCoverage
		 program.  It may not be the current version in production
		 Production versions are tagged before they are put into
		 production.

Name:    targetSeqCoverage.sh

Purpose: Gather mapping statisitics about a targeted sequencing run

INPUT:   BED, BAM, genome, and desired padding
OUTPUT:  HTML Report and .json file of mapping statistics

See script for version number, options, etc.

Installation of new target region files
---------------------------------------

New target files may be added to the targetFiles directory and will appear in the targetSeqCoverage
plugin GUI for selection provided they follow the following naming convention:
  <prefix>targetseq.<ref>.<targets id>.bed

"targetseq." and ".bed" are mandatory and used to identify the file and parse the file name.
<prefix> may be any valid string unix file name characters, but spaces are not recommended.
<ref> should reflect the actual genome (short name) the targets refer to, e.g. "hg19".
<targets id> is any suitable (short) name for the target set.

For Ion TargetSeq, a valid targets (BED) file must have at least the 3 mandatory fields,
<chromosome name>, <start> and <end> separated by a single tab character, defined for each target (per line).
Additional fields, e.g. the individual target id, are permissible and ignorred.
BED track lines (begining with "track") are ignorred but if multiple track lines are present only the first
first track is read as targets.
Ion TragetSeq files should be sorted (chromosome>start>end) and the target regions non-overlapping (merged).
